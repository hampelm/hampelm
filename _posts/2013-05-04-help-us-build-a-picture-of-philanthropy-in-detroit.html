<p><b>Update: <a href="http://detroitledger.org">we&rsquo;re live at detroitledger.org</a> – but we still need your help.</b></p>
<p>Help us build the Detroit Grants and Loans Database &ndash; a picture of philanthropy in Detroit. We’re keeping track of grants and loans given to organizations in the city of Detroit, focusing on non-profits and civic projects that receive money from foundations, and need your help to get to the next level.</p>
<p>There’s a lot of talk about the reach and impact of nonprofits and foundations in Detroit. We find ourselves curious about how much money comes into the city and how it is used. We see many amazing non-profit organizations doing great work and want to show how they put resources to good use.<b> </b><br/></p>
<p>For all of the good work that organizations are doing in Detroit, much of it happens sight unseen. It’s difficult for nonprofits, residents, and scholars to see the bigger picture of the funding system they inhabit. Some funders do a great job of listing their grants online, but many don’t. Some non-profit organizations post annual reports online, but the digital divide can make this task difficult and expensive.</p>
<p>We’ve <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmQyvM9tQNKXdGU5VGtTS0g1NktLVnRoNHNKRnJOYVE">built a spreadsheet </a>that lists close to 300 grants made in Detroit in the last year or so. It’s been a valuable resource, but it’s time to take the next step.</p>
<p><b>This summer, we&rsquo;d like to expand this data and make it easy for everyone to access</b>. As technologists in Detroit, we will build an awesome website to showcase grants and funders. But to get a comprehensive dataset, we need someone dedicated to getting the information. That’s why we’re sponsoring an internship this summer.<b> </b></p>
<p><b>We need to raise $2,500</b>: a respectful internship stipend is $1,500 a month, and we’d like to bring someone on board for 3 months. $2,000 of that $4,500 total has already been pledged. If you’re interested in getting a better understanding of the nonprofit and grant landscape in Detroit, please donate today &ndash; or email us for more details: matth@localdata.com</p>
