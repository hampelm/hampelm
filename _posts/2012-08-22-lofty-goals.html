<p>I realized this evening that there are a fair number of Detroit-focused programs that have optimistic (and in some cases unrealistic) goals:</p>
<ul><li>The <a href="http://www.hudson-webber.org/missionvision/15x15-initiative">15×15 Initiative</a>, a project from the Hudson-Webber foundation (and many others) that aims to bring 15,000 new households to Detroit&rsquo;s &ldquo;Greater Downtown&rdquo; by 2015.</li>
<li>The Skillman Foundation&rsquo;s 10-year, $100M <a href="http://www.skillman.org/Good-Neighborhoods">Good Neighborhoods</a> plan hopes to create &ldquo;good schools and good neighborhoods so that young people can be safe, healthy, educated and prepared for adulthood.&rdquo;</li>
<li>The Thompson Foundation is working to create schools that have both a 90 percent graduation rate and 90 percent of graduates attending college. According to several articles from 2005 (<a href="http://www.educationreport.org/pubs/mer/article.aspx?id=7475">one sample</a>), this goal was supposed to have been met by 2007. Schools that did not meet it were to be closed. I have not yet researched the program outcomes.  </li>
<li>The new <a href="http://detroitwiki.org/Education_Achievement_System">Educational Achievement Authority</a> run by Roy Roberts <a href="http://detroitk12.org/resources/eas/">aims to have</a> &ldquo;100 percent college- and career-ready graduates, 100 percent of third graders reading at grade level, [and] as much as 95 percent of resources going directly to the schools.&rdquo; If I recall correctly, Roberts has claimed similar goals for the Detroit Public Schools, but I don&rsquo;t have a reference immediately available. </li>
<li>The goal of the <a href="http://www.focushope.edu/page.aspx?content_id=3&amp;content_type=level1">HOPE Village Initiative</a> is that &quot;100 percent of those in the HOPE Village Initiative neighborhood will be educationally well-prepared, economically self-sufficient, and living in a safe and supportive environment by the year 2031.&ldquo; </li>
</ul>
