title: Rental inspections in Ann Arbor

In June of 2020, I built a map showing all the
[rental properties in Ann Arbor](https://matth.org/ann-arbor-rentals).

Of course, it isn't really _all_ the rentals in Ann Arbor, just those registered
with the city's rental inspection program.

As with my [ADU project](https://matth.org/adus), my goal was for this map
to be built with libraries that would still be functional 10 years from now.
It has no exeternal dependencies. I wrote about that process in a
[post last year](https://matth.org/2020/03/29/adus.html)
