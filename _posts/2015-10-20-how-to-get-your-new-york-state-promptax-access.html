The steps for getting the code are not clearly spelled out anywhere, so I called and got these instructions. </p><p>Note that this assumes you already have a NY.gov for your business (the site will prompt you to set one up if you don’t have one &ndash; that’s pretty well documented).</p><p>Here are the steps: <br/></p><ol><li>Log in to your Business Online Services account by going to <a href="http://www.tax.ny.gov/online/">http://www.tax.ny.gov/online/</a> and selecting “Log in” (I couldn’t find a direct link.</li><li>Under Services on the left side of the page, select “Employment and withholding taxes.”</li><li>Select “PrompTax withholding tax/MCTMT” from the expanded menu.</li><li>Enroll in PromptTax</li><li>After enrolling, select the “Make a payment” button at the bottom of the screen.</li><li>Copy and paste your PrompTax Access Code from the payment screen.<br/></li></ol>
